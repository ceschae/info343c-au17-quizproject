## INFO 343 Final Project Proposal

### Describe what your team is proposing to build

We propose to make a website with quizzes that generate a result based on the user's answers. User will be prompted with a multiple choice quiz embellished with pictures and an intuitive UI. After this, the quiz will spit out a result based on the answers to said question. Pre-rendered example quizzes will be provided for users to play around with at launch. We are also proposing to add a feature to this website which allows the user the tools to build their own Buzzfeed-esque quiz. Users should be able to save quizzes after creation. This, however, is a stretch goal. 

#### Possible Titles:
- Boozefeed Quizzes
- Buzfeed (only one ‘z’)
- Buzzkill Quizzes
- Online Quiz Maker 

#### Example Quizzes:
- Which booze are you?
- Which kind of hangover are you?
- We can tell what you’re REALLY like based on your Chipotle order!
- Which mid-life crisis Kanye West outfit are you?
- On a scale of 1-10, how “Pizza Rat” are you?

#### Reach Goals:
- Saving user results
- User generated quizzes
